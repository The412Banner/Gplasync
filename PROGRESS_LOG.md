## Session — 2026-08-28

### [feat] — Vanilla DXVK build jobs added to the all-in-one nightly (2026-08-28, `d64ace24` on `main`)
**Two new jobs in `new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`, both pinned to the latest upstream stable release:**
- `build-dxvk-vanilla` (std x64/x86) — repackages upstream's official `dxvk-<ver>.tar.gz` → `DXVK-v<ver>.wcp`, versionName `v<ver>`. No compile. Artifact `dxvk-vanilla`.
- `build-dxvk-arm64ec-vanilla` — cross-compiles arm64ec (LLVM-MinGW 20251104; mirrors the arm64ec gplasync job minus patches) → `DXVK-v<ver>-arm64ec.wcp`, versionName `v<ver>-arm64ec`. Artifact `dxvk-arm64ec-vanilla`.
- Wired into `create-release` `needs:`; artifacts auto-collected via existing `download-artifact merge-multiple` + `*.wcp/*.zip` upload.
- **CI-GREEN:** validated on branch run `33215950780` — both vanilla jobs success (also all 4 gplasync/binsem DXVK jobs).

#### Reconciliation note (parallel work by another session)
While this was on branch `feat/dxvk-vanilla-aio-jobs`, `origin/main` independently gained the **same gplasync fix** (`d402935e` — DxvkAttachment shadow field, identical `.view` member-access approach) plus a **compile-guard hardening** (`e81c0fb2` — real compile guard with v3.0 fallback). So my duplicate patch fix (branch commit `158288d2`) was **dropped**; only the vanilla-jobs commit was cherry-picked onto `origin/main` (`52458184` → `d64ace24`). No clobber. Both features coexist (verified: 14 jobs, both vanilla jobs + the v3.0 compile-guard fallback present).

#### ⚠️ Known: FEXCore master breakage (NOT DXVK, left for now per user)
`Build FEXCore` + `(PPA flavor)` fail on FEX **master** `config_generator.py:425 assert "AffectsCodeGen" in op_vals` — a recent FEX commit added/renamed a config option without the marker. FEX passed at 21:14 + in the 20:31 nightly. Blocks the nightly publish (hard `needs`) until upstream fixes it or FEX is pinned. Documented; no action this session.

## Session — 2026-08-06

### [feat] — Add D7VK (DirectDraw/D3D7) all-in-one component (2026-08-06)
**Branch `feat/d7vk-aio-component` → FF-merged to `main` (`5d6ceb4e`); real publish run `31136317325` success.**

#### What changed
- New `build-d7vk` job in `new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`. Builds
  `WinterSnowfall/d7vk` **`devel`** branch (pinned `--branch devel`) — the 2.x PRODUCT
  line (latest v2.x tags). Deliberately NOT `master` (that's a DXVK-3.0.2-rebase line; the
  `v3.0.2` tag + meson `version:'3.0.2'` are the DXVK base, not the d7vk product version).
- Reuses the DXVK harness (mingw + ccache keyed to devel HEAD + glslang). **32-bit only**
  (package-release.sh `opt_32_only=1`); ships ONLY `syswow64/ddraw.dll` (statically links
  own d3d9 → self-contained; does not touch container DXVK d3d9/d3d11/dxgi).
- **GCC/mingw shim (required):** devel uses clang-only `std::sqrtf` (libstdc++/mingw doesn't
  expose it in `std::`) → rewrite to `std::sqrt` before building. Plus fallback to last
  product tag if devel still won't build.
- Version label `<latest-product-tag>-<commit>-nightly` (e.g. `v2.1-bc3b29b9e-nightly`).
  Artifacts `d7vk-<version>.{tzst,wcp,zip}`. `.tzst` = drop-in refresh for the app's bundled
  `assets/ddrawrapper/d7vk.tzst`. profile.json type `D7VK`.
- create-release wired: `needs`, version env, built-components + files-included tables,
  README block, upstream-status array, and `*.tzst` added to the release + nightly-latest
  upload globs. `nightlies-components-json.yml` classifies `d7vk-*` as type `D7VK`.
  `Upstream-watcher.yml` tracks `WinterSnowfall/d7vk` (HEAD=devel) → new commits trigger a
  nightly and show under "What changed".
- Published: `nightly-20260807-010254` + `nightly-latest` carry `d7vk-v2.1-bc3b29b9e-nightly.
  {tzst,wcp,zip}`; manifest has 2 D7VK entries.
- ⚠️ Known convention gap: the auto-manifest derives `verName` from the FILENAME stem
  (`d7vk-…`, needed so the classifier greps "d7vk"), which differs from the .wcp's
  profile.json versionName (`v2.1-…`). Pre-existing for all manifest components; the
  winlator-contents catalog uses the correct version-matching verName.

### [feat] — FEX build naming: stable (on-tag) vs nightly (+N drift) (2026-07-03)
**PR #8 → merged to `main` (squash, tip `5a64177`).**

#### Problem
`git describe --tags --abbrev=0` strips the `-N-gSHA` suffix, so a FEX build cut from a
commit *past* a release tag was named identically to the true on-tag release. Today's HEAD
`1d695f6db` is **2 commits past the `FEX-2607` tag** (tag at `1cc4b93e`) yet shipped as clean
`FEX-2607` — indistinguishable from an exact-tag release.

#### Fix
Name by distance from the nearest FEX tag (`git rev-list <tag>..HEAD --count`):
- exactly on tag → **`FEXCore-<ver>-stable`** (non-PPA) / **`FEXCore-<ver>-stable-ppa`** (PPA)
- N past tag → **`FEX-<ver>+N-Nightly-<sha>`** / `…-PPA`

Applied to both FEX blocks in the all-in-one nightly (non-PPA + PPA; PPA `VERSION_SHORT`
flows to profile.json), the standalone-nightly fallback, and the PPA-stable file-stem.
VKD3D/DXVK/Box64 untouched. `+` survives GitHub asset upload. Post-merge test runs:
standalone auto-produced `FEX-2607+2-Nightly-1d695f6db`; all-in-one produced both flavors'
drift names. Retro-renamed today's mislabeled `nightly-latest` FEX assets to `+2` and
repointed the 4 pinned URLs in `nightlies_components.json`.

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`
- `.github/workflows/fexcore-standalone-nightly.yml`
- `.github/workflows/fexcore-ppa-stable.yml` (file-stem → `FEXCore-<ver>-stable-ppa`)
- `nightlies_components.json`

### [chore] — Cut FEXCore 2607 stables (non-PPA + PPA) from the exact tag (2026-07-03)
Built from `FEX-2607` (commit `1cc4b93e`), delivered to device `/sdcard/Download`:
- Non-PPA: release `fexcore-nightly-20260703-142726` → `FEXCore-2607-stable.wcp/.zip`
- PPA: release `fexcore-ppa-FEX-2607-1cc4b93e7` → `FEXCore-2607-stable-ppa.wcp/.zip`

Cleanups: deleted a stray `glslang-master-linux-Release.zip` swept into both releases by the
`*.zip` upload glob (**TODO:** exclude glslang from the glob). Note the standalone workflow
hardcodes `make_latest:true`; `nightly-latest` is a prerelease so can't hold Latest anyway.

**PPA-fidelity decompile (ours vs `nickppa` vs official-2605):** no official 2607 PPA exists
yet (Launchpad newest = 2605). Ours = faithful mirror (bylaws clang 21.1.0, DWARF,
`//fex-emu/HostThunks`, +0.2% size vs official 2605). `nickppa` = genuine 2607 (99.99%
instruction-identical) but NOT PPA-faithful ("PPA build flags" false — standard HostThunks
path; "No strip" misleading — zero DWARF). All run games identically.

---

### [research] — FEXCore unixlib transition (2607+): DECISION = WAIT (2026-07-03)
FEX 2607 now ships **4 files** for Wine (2 PE DLL + 2 native `.so` unixlib); `.so` is a
companion, not a replacement. Optional now, likely mandatory "in a few months" (FEX PRs
#5612/#5637, merged 06-28→06-30). Loads via custom `NtQueryVirtualMemory(MemoryWineLoadUnixLibByName)`
needing FEX-patched Wine. Bannerlator's Protons (9.0 + 11.0-5) are **bionic NDK** builds
with **no loader** → adding `.so` to the FEX nightly wcp does nothing (glibc ABI, wrong dir,
no loader). `.so` belong in a rebuilt bionic Proton, not the FEX wcp. **Decision: keep FEX
nightlies DLL-only; do NOT rebuild Proton yet** — wait for FEX to stabilize (triggers:
official 2607 PPA / 2608 tag / unixlib made non-optional). No workflow change.

## Session — 2026-07-02

### [feat] — All-in-one DXVK builds track upstream master + vendored Ph42oN master gplasync patch (2026-07-02)
**Branch:** `feat/dxvk-master-gplasync` (`5056457a`) → **merged to `main` via merge commit `0ca2ebe2`** (no-ff, branch deleted).

#### Problem
The 2026-06-30 v3.0 pin fixed the red runs but froze all 4 gplasync DXVK assets at the
v3.0 commit `97fe0c66` — every hourly release republished a byte-identical DXVK while the
release header looked new. Requirement: every DXVK build = upstream `doitsujin/dxvk`
**latest master commit** + Ph42oN's **newest master gplasync patch** ("true gplasync"),
with the patch vendored in this repo. Scope: all-in-one workflow only (nvapi no longer
built; standalone workflow left pinned/untouched).

#### Fix (`new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`, all 4 gplasync jobs: std / arm64ec / binsem / binsem-arm64ec)
- Clone dxvk **master** (dropped `--branch v3.0`) and apply the vendored
  `patches/dxvk-gplasync-master.patch` via `patch -p1 --fuzz=3` (`git apply` rejects it on
  master due to context drift; fuzz applies it — 1 hunk at fuzz 2).
- **Refreshed the stale vendored master patch** to Ph42oN's newest (`40b31c3`, 2026-06-28)
  — the stale local copy was the root cause of the 6/30 breakage.
- **Fallback, never hard-fail:** dry-run the master patch first; on failure → re-clone
  `v3.0` + newly vendored `patches/dxvk-gplasync-3.0-1.patch` + `::warning::` telling us to
  re-vendor. Version/hash computed from whichever tree actually built.
- binsem layer switched `git apply` → `patch --fuzz=3` for the same drift tolerance
  (verified it applies cleanly on today's master).
- **Safety:** `create-release` gated `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` — branch
  dispatches build everything but can never publish or clobber `nightly-latest`.

#### Proof
Branch dispatch run `28557132326`: **all 14 jobs green**, release correctly skipped.
Artifacts confirm the master path executed (not the fallback): all 4 variants =
`…-eea51bab.wcp` (dxvk master HEAD at build time), not `97fe0c66`. Filenames keep the
dynamic `v3.0-` `git describe` prefix by choice (rolls to v3.1 automatically when upstream
tags it). Build-proven only — not device-tested.

#### Shipped + follow-ups (same session)
- Manual `main` dispatch run `28557928482` all-green → **release `nightly-20260702-011327`
  published and `nightly-latest` refreshed with all 4 DXVK variants at `eea51bab`** —
  the fix is live in production.
- **Issue #7** (Betaminos, "DXVK stuck at 97fe0c66?") — the report that surfaced the bug —
  answered with the full root-cause/fix explanation and **closed** with the release as proof.
- `3e2bdc97` (display-only metadata, ships from the *next* nightly): VKD3D profile.json
  `description` raw-hash → attribution line matching the DXVK style; FEX-PPA `versionName`
  bare `2605` → `FEX-2605-PPA` (deliberately overrides the old byte-for-byte PPA-metadata
  mirror on that one field; comment updated). `versionCode` 0/1 values left alone by
  decision — nothing version-compares wcps today.

## Session — 2026-06-30

### [fix] — Pin DXVK v3.0 + switch to Ph42oN's official gplasync-3.0-1 patch (the "revert to curl once upstream rebases" follow-up) (2026-06-30)
**Branch:** `fix/dxvk-gplasync-3.0-pin` (`c6e81909`) → **merged to `main` via merge commit `f881c5ce`** (no-ff; main had advanced to `65a6041` w/ a components-json auto-commit, so a real merge — no conflicts, only the 3 DXVK workflow YAMLs).

#### Problem
The vendored `patches/dxvk-gplasync-master.patch` from the 2026-06-03 session drifted AGAIN.
All 4 DXVK jobs went red for 30+ consecutive "All-in-One Emulation Nightlies" runs (Box64 /
VKD3D / FEXCore stayed green), failing at the **"Clone & Patch DXVK"** step. DXVK `HEAD`
(floating) moved past the rebased patch → hunks no longer apply:
- `src/dxvk/dxvk_context.cpp:6668` → patch does not apply
- `src/dxvk/dxvk_graphics.cpp:1415` → patch does not apply
Last failed run at diagnosis: `28432926425`.

#### Fix
The 2026-06-03 note said "revert to curl once he rebases upstream main." That condition is
now MET: DXVK upstream tagged **`v3.0`**, and Ph42oN published **`dxvk-gplasync-3.0-1.patch`**
(2026-06-28, GitLab `Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync`). So we stop chasing floating `HEAD`:
1. **Pin the clone** to `--branch v3.0` in all DXVK jobs (no more `git describe` of a moving
   target driving the build source).
2. **Switch the gplasync source** from the vendored master patch back to the official tagged
   patch, curl'd from `https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync/-/raw/main/patches/dxvk-gplasync-3.0-1.patch`.
3. ⚠️ **Applied via `patch -p1 --fuzz=3`, NOT `git apply`** — the official 3.0-1 patch was built
   against a slightly different DXVK 3.0 source blob than the `v3.0` git tag (context.cpp blob
   `c84cf342` vs tag `d8da03e3`; one hunk's leading context line is `GpIndependentSets);` in the
   patch vs `GpDirtyDepthBias));` in the tag). `git apply` refuses on that context mismatch;
   `patch --fuzz=3` applies cleanly (one hunk needs fuzz 1, rest are pure offsets, anchoring on
   the unique `getPipelineHandle`/`updateRenderTargets` lines). Documented inline in the YAML.
   Added `patch` to the 4 DXVK apt installs.
4. The 2 BinSem jobs **keep `git apply` for `dxvk-binary-semaphores.patch`** — it still applies
   clean against `v3.0` with no rebase (touches only `dxvk_cmdlist.{cpp,h}` / `dxvk_queue.{cpp,h}`,
   no gplasync overlap). Verified locally (exit 0) and on CI.

#### Verification
- **Branch CI run `28435269627`** — all 14 build jobs green incl. all 4 DXVK
  (GPLAsync / ARM64EC / BinSem GPLAsync / BinSem ARM64EC), all built from DXVK `v3.0` commit
  `97fe0c66`. (The branch run's only red was the `Update README` push step — it auto-commits +
  pushes and only works on the default branch; irrelevant to DXVK.)
- **Post-merge manual dispatch on `main` — run `28436548767`: `success`, ALL jobs green**,
  including `Create Nightly Release` and its `Update README` step (confirming the branch-run
  red was purely a non-default-branch artifact). Release `nightly-20260630-101231` published
  (Latest) + rolling `nightly-latest` refreshed, both carrying v3.0-built DXVK.
- Build-proven + release-published. DXVK 3.0 runtime rendering NOT yet device-tested.

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml` (orchestrator — 4 DXVK jobs)
- `.github/workflows/dxvk-binsem-nightly.yml` (`base_ref` default `master`→`v3.0`; both BinSem jobs)
- `.github/workflows/dxvk-standalone-nightly.yml` (all 4 jobs)

#### Flagged / not done
- `dxvk-stable-matrix-nightly.yml` **intentionally untouched** — no drift bug (it already pins
  per-version tags + version-matched local patches for 2.5–2.7.1, never the master patch).
  Adding a 3.0 row = separate enhancement (needs committed local `dxvk-gplasync-3.0-1.patch` +
  `dxvk-binary-semaphores-3.0.patch`).
- Optional hardening: guard the `Update README` step with `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
  so non-default-branch dispatches go fully green. Out of scope here.

## Session — 2026-06-03

### [fix] — Rebase + vendor gplasync master patch (DXVK cc418519 broke it); fix build-dxvk checkout (2026-06-03)
**Commits:** `84d41ff` (patch rebase + vendor), `b38eb9b` (build-dxvk checkout)

#### Problem
All 4 DXVK gplasync jobs went red starting 2026-06-01. Root cause: DXVK upstream
commit `cc418519` ("[dxvk] Fix thread synchronization on pipeline compiles") rewrote
`DxvkGraphicsPipeline::getOptimizedPipeline` in `src/dxvk/dxvk_graphics.cpp`:
- `m_fastPipelines.insert({ key, handle })` → `m_fastPipelines.emplace(std::piecewise_construct, …)`
- single compile path → `if (entry.second) { …compile…; return handle; } else { …spin-wait… }`

Ph42oN's `dxvk-gplasync-master.patch` (upstream main, last touched 2025-12-29 — he had
NOT fixed it) anchors `m_async = false;` on the old `insert` block → `patch does not apply`
at `dxvk_graphics.cpp:1397`. Jobs clone DXVK `HEAD` (floating), so it broke live.

#### Fix
1. **Rebased the patch** — only one hunk changed: moved `m_async = false;` into the new
   `if (entry.second)` compile branch, right before its `return handle;`. Preserves the
   original semantics (reset on the actual-compile path only; cache-hit early-return does
   not reset). All other hunks + the binsem patch (touches cmdlist/queue, unaffected) apply
   clean. Verified `git apply --check` exit 0 on pristine DXVK HEAD `840d147`; binsem applies
   on top.
2. **Vendored** the rebased patch at `patches/dxvk-gplasync-master.patch` and switched all 4
   DXVK jobs from `curl …Ph42oN…|git apply` to `git apply "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/patches/dxvk-gplasync-master.patch"`.
   Trade-off: no longer auto-tracks Ph42oN — **revert to curl once he rebases upstream main.**
3. `build-dxvk` (plain GPLAsync std job) had NO `actions/checkout` (it only ever curl'd the
   patch) → first re-run failed with `can't open patch … No such file or directory`. Added a
   `Checkout (for patch file)` step (the other 3 DXVK jobs already had one).

#### Verification
- Run `26873026129` — all 4 DXVK jobs green (compiled + packaged): Build DXVK (GPLAsync),
  Build DXVK BinSem (GPLAsync), Build DXVK (ARM64EC), Build DXVK BinSem (ARM64EC).
- Build-proven only; runtime async-correctness under the new sync model NOT device-tested.
- Filed-issue-on-Ph42oN: drafted, not posted (no GitLab creds in env).

#### Files touched
- `patches/dxvk-gplasync-master.patch` (vendored, rebased)
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml` (4 jobs → local apply; build-dxvk checkout)

## Session — 2026-05-13

### [feat] — Surface Banners-Turnip releases in nightlies_components.json (2026-05-13)

#### What changed
- `nightlies-components-json.yml` already fetched all Banners-Turnip releases on every run, but the loop body appended only to `turnip_driver_entries[]` (→ `banners-turnip_drivers.json` + `drivers.json`) and explicitly skipped `entries[]` (→ `nightlies_components.json`), per a "catalog stays focused on emulator/translation layers" policy.
- Flipped the policy: turnip entries now `entries.append(entry)` alongside the existing `turnip_driver_entries.append(entry)`. `banners-turnip_drivers.json` and `drivers.json` still written exactly as before (mirror workflows in kimchi/stevenmxz/mtr/white/all-in-one are unaffected).
- Result: on next run of the watcher, `nightlies_components.json` gains a `type: "GpuDriver"` row per turnip `.zip` asset across all Banners-Turnip tags. Subsequent runs idempotently re-scan all tags, so new releases land automatically with no state file.

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/nightlies-components-json.yml` (lines 193-195: replaced 3-line "NOT added" comment + lone append with two appends)

#### Trigger
- Watcher runs on `workflow_run` (completed) + cron + `workflow_dispatch`. Will pick up automatically on the next trigger, or can be kicked manually with `gh workflow run nightlies-components-json.yml`.

## Session — 2026-05-08

### [feat] — Add `.wcp.xz` Wine + Proton entries to components catalog (2026-05-08)
**Commits:** `ff7c02c` (initial add) → re-applied as `d004d9d` after watcher wipe

#### What changed
- Manually added `wine-11.3-arm64ec` and `proton-10-arm64ec` to `nightlies_components.json` (158 → 160). Both back `.wcp.xz` assets in the `Proton/wine` release that the watcher's `.wcp` / `.zip` filter currently skips.
- First add (`ff7c02c`) was wiped by the watcher (`86fec95`, regenerated back to 158). Recovered via rebase + re-insert in `d004d9d`.

#### Files touched
- `nightlies_components.json`

#### Known follow-up
- Watcher (`nightlies-components-json.yml`) only ingests `.wcp` / `.zip`; any `.wcp.xz` adds remain a manual-maintenance burden until the workflow is taught to include them.

---

### [docs] — Add Component Catalog (JSON Index) section to README (2026-05-08)
**Commit:** `c42b2d1`

#### What changed
- New top-level section between the intro and "Latest Nightly Releases" pointing to `The412Banner/winlator-contents` and the raw `contents.json` URL, so Winlator-family clients have a discoverable entry point for the catalog.

#### Files touched
- `README.md`

---

### [chore] — Strip `nightly-latest` entries from components catalog (2026-05-08)
**Commit:** `b2d392e`

#### What changed
- Removed all 22 `nightly-latest` rolling-tag entries (160 → 138): 8 Box64 · 4 DXVK · 4 VKD3D · 4 WOWBox64 · 2 FEXCore.
- Reason: `nightly-latest` entries duplicated archived versions and carried type/filename mismatches (WOWBox64 builds filed under Box64 and vice versa).
- Mirrored the same delete to `winlator-contents/contents.json` (`5b0bfc9` on that repo).

#### Files touched
- `nightlies_components.json`

#### Known follow-up
- Workflow `nightlies-components-json.yml` lines 98–115 unconditionally re-fetch the `nightly-latest` tag, so this delete will be reverted on the next workflow run unless those lines are removed.

## Session — 2026-03-23

### [fix] — Add actions: write permission to Create Nightly Release job (2026-03-23)
**Commit:** `278522f`

#### What changed
- `new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`: added `actions: write` to the `Create Nightly Release` job's `permissions` block
- Root cause: `gh workflow run nightlies-components-json.yml` requires `actions: write` on `GITHUB_TOKEN`; job only had `contents: write`, causing HTTP 403 on every run

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`

## Session — 2026-03-06

### [feat] — Dynamic release notes + upstream change tracking (2026-03-06)
**Commit:** `c783331`

#### What changed

**Upstream-watcher.yml:**
- Added `NAMES` array mapping each repo URL to a friendly display name
- Before overwriting `upstream_hashes.txt`, captures old hash per repo to detect what changed
- For each changed repo: fetches commit message + date from GitHub API
- Builds `CHANGED_JSON` array (repo, name, old hash, new hash, full hash, message, date)
- Writes `upstream_changes.json` with `triggered_at` timestamp + `changed` array
- Commits both `upstream_hashes.txt` and `upstream_changes.json` when changes detected
- Triggers `new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml` (unchanged trigger mechanism)

**new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml (create-release job):**
- Added `actions/checkout@v4` step so the job can read `upstream_changes.json`
- Added `Build Release Body` step:
  - Queries GitHub API live for all 6 upstream repos (latest commit hash, message, date)
  - Marks any repo updated in last 24h with 🆕 badge in status table
  - Reads `upstream_changes.json` — if written within the last 3 hours, generates "🔄 What Triggered This Build" table with old→new commit links
  - Writes full release body to `release_body.md`
- Switched from `body:` (static inline) to `body_path: release_body.md` in softprops action
- Added disclaimer to top of every nightly release body:
  `⚠️ DISCLAIMER: NIGHTLY BUILDS ARE NOT ALWAYS STABLE OR RECOMMENDED! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! STABLE RELEASES ARE ALWAYS BEST TO USE!`

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/Upstream-watcher.yml`
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`

### [chore] — Disclaimer added to all existing nightly releases (2026-03-06)
**Method:** `gh release edit` loop via CLI (no commit)

## Session — 2026-03-11

### [feat] — Proton Bleeding-Edge ARM64EC standalone workflow (2026-03-11)
**Commits:** `491632a` (initial), `9943fa9`→`e9c28db` (release notes fix)

#### What changed

**New file: `.github/workflows/proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml`**
- Standalone workflow to build ValveSoftware/wine `bleeding-edge` branch with GameNative Android + ARM64EC patches
- Schedules every 6 hours + `workflow_dispatch` (inputs: `wine_ref`, `gamenative_ref`, `target_app_id`, `force_build`)
- **Job 0 — sync-scripts:** Fetches all build scripts/patches from Pepelespooder/proton-arm64-nightlies via GitHub API, compares byte-for-byte, commits any changes to `proton-scripts/`. Gracefully skips if upstream unavailable. Local copies act as permanent fallback.
- **Job 2 — build:** Clones ValveSoftware/wine + GameNative/proton-wine, applies patches from `proton-scripts/`, downloads LLVM MinGW 20250920 (bylaws) + NDK r27d + termuxfs aarch64, compiles full ARM64EC Wine, packages `.wcp` (zstd-tar) and `.wcp.xz` (XZ-tar + prefixPack) with SHA256
- **Job 3 — release:** Queries GitHub API live for wine bleeding-edge commit info, builds styled release notes matching all-in-one format, always publishes a release (no skip gate), updates and commits `proton-latest.json`
- Release tag format: `proton-bleeding-edge-{date}-{hash}-run{N}`
- Release is always pre-release

**New file: `proton-scripts/`** (39 files)
- Full backup of all build dependencies from Pepelespooder's repo
- `scripts/` — 26 Python/shell scripts (filter_patches.py, patch_build_script.py, fix_*.py, generate_profile.py, create-proton-wcp.sh, verify_required_markers.py, etc.)
- `ge-second-pass/test-bylaws/` — 2 BYLAWS patch overrides
- `ge-second-pass/focus/`, `keyboard/`, `mouse/`, `performance/` — additional patches
- `patches/` — dlls_winex11_drv_window_c.patch

**New file: `proton-latest.json`**
- Tracks last built Wine hash, version name, WCP/WCP.XZ filenames + SHA256 checksums, release tag
- Read by release job to determine old hash for "What Triggered" section

**Modified: `.github/workflows/Upstream-watcher.yml`**
- Added ValveSoftware/wine `bleeding-edge` branch tracking (separate from the main 5-repo loop)
- Stored under key `https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine@bleeding-edge: <hash>` in `upstream_hashes.txt`
- New output: `wine_changed` (true when wine bleeding-edge HEAD changes)
- New output: `anything_changed` (true when any hash changed — used for commit step)
- New trigger step: `gh workflow run "proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml"` fires when `wine_changed == true`
- Existing `changed` output still triggers all-in-one nightly as before

#### Release note format (matching all-in-one style)
- Disclaimer at top
- `### 🚀 Proton Bleeding-Edge Build: {tag}`
- `### 🔄 What Triggered This Build` — old→new wine hash table when hash changed; "Scheduled/manual" otherwise
- `### 📊 Upstream Status` — wine bleeding-edge commit with 🆕 badge if updated in last 24h
- `### 📦 Built Components` — Proton ARM64EC row with commit link
- `### 📦 Files Included` — WCP + WCP.XZ with sha256 note

#### Bug fixed
- **Heredoc PY terminator not found (run6):** Triple-quoted f-string content had zero YAML indentation. YAML calculated min-indent=0 so stripped nothing — the `PY` end-marker kept 10 leading spaces in the shell script and bash never matched it. Fixed by replacing `f"""..."""` with `list` + `"\n".join()` so all lines stay indented inside the Python block.

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml` (new)
- `.github/workflows/Upstream-watcher.yml`
- `proton-scripts/` (new directory, 39 files)
- `proton-latest.json` (new)

## Session — 2026-03-11 (continued)

### [fix] — Rebase conflict fix + release description improvements (2026-03-11)
**Commit:** `dfacb3f`

#### What changed
- `git pull --rebase -X ours` in "Commit proton-latest.json" step — concurrent runs no longer fail with a merge conflict; current run's version of `proton-latest.json` always wins
- Added `⬇️ Download` section to release description with a per-file table (file name, description, link) and a "Which file do I need?" callout explaining `.wcp` vs `.wcp.xz`

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml`

---

### [fix] — sync-scripts rebase conflict fix (2026-03-11)
**Commit:** `76645fe`

#### What changed
- `git pull --rebase -X ours` also applied to the sync-scripts job commit step (same race condition as release job — if two concurrent runs both detect upstream script changes, the second would conflict)

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml`

---

### [feat] — Auto-update README with latest releases after every build (2026-03-11)
**Commits:** `35fb31a` (proton README), `6142553` (all-in-one README + combined section)

#### What changed

**README.md:**
- Replaced single `## 🍷 Latest Proton Bleeding-Edge Release` section with a combined `## 🌙 Latest Nightly Releases` section containing two sub-sections:
  - `### 📦 All-in-One Emulation Nightly` — updated by all-in-one workflow; markers: `<!-- NIGHTLY-LATEST-START/END -->`
  - `### 🍷 Proton Bleeding-Edge ARM64EC` — updated by proton workflow; markers: `<!-- PROTON-LATEST-START/END -->`

**proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml (Create GitHub Release step):**
- Python block also rewrites `README.md` between `PROTON-LATEST-START/END` markers after writing release notes
- Table shows: release link, wine commit link + message, date, asset download link
- Commit step stages `README.md` alongside `proton-latest.json`

**new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml (create-release job):**
- New `Update README with latest nightly` step after `Create GitHub Release`
- Python block rewrites `README.md` between `NIGHTLY-LATEST-START/END` markers
- Table shows: release link, FEX commit+version, VKD3D std+ARM64EC commits, DXVK std+ARM64EC commits, Box64 repo links, asset download link
- Commits and pushes `README.md` with `git pull --rebase -X ours`

#### Files touched
- `README.md`
- `.github/workflows/proton-bleeding-edge-nightly.yml`
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`

### [feat] — Kimchi Driver Mirror workflow (2026-03-16)
**Commit:** `0d9bd05`

#### What changed

**New file: `.github/workflows/kimchi-driver-mirror.yml`**
- Mirrors all releases from K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers (154 releases, 200 assets, ~938 MB total)
- Runs daily at 06:00 UTC + `workflow_dispatch` (optional `force_full_sync` boolean input)
- **Storage:** actual `.zip` files uploaded as assets on a persistent `kimchi-drivers` release (pre-release, never deleted); filenames prefixed with sanitized tag name to avoid collisions (e.g. `v26.0.0-rc08_Turnip_v26.0.0_R8.zip`)
- **Index:** `kimchi/drivers.json` committed to repo — contains `updated_at`, `source`, `mirror_release`, `total_releases`, `total_assets`, and per-release asset list with `name`, `mirror_name`, `size`, `original_url`, `mirror_url`, `published_at`
- **Incremental:** skips assets already present in the mirror release (by name) or already in `drivers.json` with a `mirror_url`; `force_full_sync` re-downloads everything
- `timeout-minutes: 360` — initial full sync can take up to 6h
- `git pull --rebase -X ours` on drivers.json commit step

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/kimchi-driver-mirror.yml` (new)
- `kimchi/drivers.json` (created on first run)

## Session — 2026-03-21

### [feat] — MTR manual_entries.json + v3.0.0 drivers (2026-03-21)
**Commit:** TBD

#### What changed
- Created `mtr/manual_entries.json` — static list of manually added drivers that survive workflow reruns; any entry whose filename isn't already in the source repo sync is appended to `mtr/drivers.json` after each run
- Added new "Merge manual entries" step to `mtr-driver-mirror.yml` — runs between "Download and mirror" and "Write root mtr_drivers.json"; reads `mtr/manual_entries.json` and appends missing entries by name
- Updated commit step to also stage `mtr/manual_entries.json`
- Added `Turnip_MTR_v3.0.0-b_Axxx.zip` and `Turnip_MTR_v3.0.0-p_Axxx.zip` (manually uploaded to mtr-drivers release, not yet in maxjivi05's repo) to all three JSON files: `mtr/drivers.json`, `mtr_drivers.json`, `drivers.json`

#### Files touched
- `mtr/manual_entries.json` (new)
- `mtr/drivers.json` (total_assets 33→35, two v3.0.0 entries added)
- `mtr_drivers.json` (two v3.0.0 entries added)
- `drivers.json` (two v3.0.0 entries inserted after v2.0.0-p)
- `.github/workflows/mtr-driver-mirror.yml` (new "Merge manual entries" step + manual_entries.json staged in commit)

---

### [feat] — Add MTR v3.2.0-b and v3.2.0-p to JSON tracking (2026-03-25)
**Commit:** `9d2da14`

#### What changed
- Added `Turnip_MTR_v3.2.0-b_Axxx` and `Turnip_MTR_v3.2.0-p_Axxx` entries to `mtr/drivers.json` (total_assets 35→37)
- Added matching `GpuDriver` entries to `mtr_drivers.json`
- Both entries point to mirror URLs under the `mtr-drivers` release tag

#### Files touched
- `mtr/drivers.json`
- `mtr_drivers.json`

---

### [fix] — Replace DXVK-NVAPI with Turnip in upstream status table (2026-03-18)
**Commit:** `e238ebb`

#### What changed
- Removed `jp7677/dxvk-nvapi` from `REPOS` array in `create-release` job status table
- Replaced with `The412Banner/Banners-Turnip`
- `NAMES` array updated: `"DXVK-NVAPI"` → `"Turnip (Banners)"`
- Upstream status table now shows Turnip commit status instead of the removed NVAPI project

#### Files touched
- `.github/workflows/new-All-in-one-nightly+zips-latest-stable.yml`

## 2026-09-06 — VKD3D-Proton relax_wave_size experimental build (artifact-only)

**Why:** Serious Sam Shatterverse (UE 5.5.4, SM6-only, `[WaveSize(32)]` compute shaders) dies at frame 1 on Adreno 750 / Turnip (subgroup range 64..128): vkd3d `d3d12_device_validate_shader_meta` rejects 39 compute PSOs (`Required WaveSize range [32, 32], but supported range is [64, 128]`) → UE `80070057` → RenderThread null-PSO AV.

**What:** new workflow `.github/workflows/vkd3d-wave-relax.yml` (workflow_dispatch, artifact-only, no release, no catalog change) builds upstream vkd3d-proton pinned at `d01924b6` (same commit as the installed `3.0.1-d01924b6-1` profile) with `patches/vkd3d-proton-relax-wave-size.patch`:
- new `VKD3D_CONFIG` flags `relax_wave_size` / `no_relax_wave_size` (`config_flag_decl.h`, `reserved0` 26→24 to keep the 96-bit STATIC_ASSERT)
- `device.c`: relax flag is DEFAULT-ON (set in `vkd3d_instance_deduce_config_flags_from_environment` unless `no_relax_wave_size`); `d3d12_device_validate_shader_meta` no longer returns false when the required range misses the device range — one-time WARN instead
- `state.c`: `vkd3d_setup_shader_stage` clamps `requiredSubgroupSize` into `[minSubgroupSize, maxSubgroupSize]` (32 → 64 on Adreno) so Vulkan never sees an illegal size
- dxil-spirv untouched (verified: WaveGetLaneCount lowers to dynamic `BuiltInSubgroupSize`, no `OpExecutionMode SubgroupSize` emitted)
- x64 + x86 only (game is x64; syswow64 for profile parity). profile versionName `3.1.0-wave64-relax` / versionCode 1 → installs as `3.1.0-wave64-relax-1`.
- Patch does NOT apply to upstream master (`35bdee14`, uses `d3d12_caps.options1.WaveLaneCount*` + ALLOW_WAVE32 machinery) — re-derive if ever rebased.

**Caveat:** shaders assuming exactly 32 lanes for wave intrinsics may mis-render; this is a compat hack, not a fix. Device-proof pending.
